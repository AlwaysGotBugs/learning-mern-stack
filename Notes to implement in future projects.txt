Pro tips:
	-make routes + controllers folders
	-handle routes in server.js by defining a route parent url requiring a route.js file
		ex: backend/server.js
	-in controllers files: handle the actions of the routes by placing them in one file
		ex: mern\backend\controllers\goalController.js
	-in routes files: routes with same url but different action methods can be grouped up
		ex: router.route('/').get(getGoals).post(setGoal)
