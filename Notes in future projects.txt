Pro tips:
	-make routes + controllers folders
	-handle routes in server.js by defining a route parent url requiring a route.js file
		ex: backend/server.js
	-in controllers files: handle the actions of the routes by placing them in one file
		ex: mern\backend\controllers\goalController.js
	-in routes files: routes with same url but different action methods can be grouped up
		ex: router.route('/').get(getGoals).post(setGoal)
	-override the errorhandler so it displays certain useful information in production (not in development)
		ex: 28:40 in the youtube video
	-Use the  error handler instead of the try catch by downloading the express async handler
		install: npm i express-async-handler outside the backend folder ( in the root folder)
